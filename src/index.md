# Introducing ClockworkJS

**ClockworkJS** is a distribution of tools and technologies, configured to make the building of static websites as easy and hassle free as possible.

## Based on Gulp
ClockworkJS uses the latest version of Gulp to automate CSS preprocessing and image minification. Additionally, Gulp is used to control sub-processes, such as JavaScript module management, live browser testing and static site generation.

## Do More, Type Less
Whenever possible, ClockworkJS uses syntax-light solutions to make website production fast and efficient. CSS is written using the Stylus preprocessing language. Markup is written as Pug templates. CoffeeScript is used for JavaScript transpilation.

## Infinitely Customizable
Don't like Stylus, Pug or CoffeeScript? Clockwork was designed with modularity in mind. Simply add, remove or delete Gulp modules to create a build system that best reflects your own work flow.
